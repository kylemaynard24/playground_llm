The file path you provided is not a valid path. It appears to be a template for a file path, but it is not a valid file path on its own. To use this template, you would need to replace the placeholders with actual values for the user name and repository name. For example:

/Users/<username>/git_playground/application/templated_prompts/template_for__Users_<username>_git_playground_model_tuning_Modelfile.txt

This file path would then be a valid file path that corresponds to the template you provided.
